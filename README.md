# win32_gui

* C++ Win32 gui draft project used to experiment with [xtd](https://gammasoft71.wixsite.com/xtdpro).
* DO NOT USE this project for your projects.
* I put it at the disposal of the community because it can be an inspiration for you and because it could be a good start to start a Win32 project properly.

## This project contains

* A basic application class that allows to start and stop the Windows event loop
* A control class which is the basis for all other controls.
* An elegant way to receive the events in all the controls and to process them cleanly in C++.

## Remarks

If you want a complete project on which to base your development, please use [xtd](https://gammasoft71.wixsite.com/xtdpro).
